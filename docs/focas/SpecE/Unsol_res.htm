<h2>When you use the PMC address for the control parameter(Response Notice method)</h2>

<ul>

<blockquote>

   <p>In the Response Notice method, the method to use the PMC address as the control data is explained.</p>
   <p>The "R" or "E" address data of PMC is used to transmit the message from CNC. If you use the unsolicited messaging function, the ladder program by which the signal is controlled as follows is necessary.
            <table  border="2" bordercolorlight="Black" bordercolordark="Black">
                <tr><td>Note) In case of 30i/31i/32i, the macro variable can be also used for the transmission data.  In the following explanations, the PMC address is used as the transmission data.</td></tr>
            </table>
<br/>
<li>Explanation of PMC address signal for control</li>

    <p>Details of the PMC address signal for the control used for the unsolicited messaging function are shown.  The consecutive PMC address in two bytes is necessary to control.</p>
    <p>The example which uses "Rxxxx" as PMC address for the control is shown.</p>
