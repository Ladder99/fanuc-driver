<h2>Communication with Ethernet Board</h2>


<p>
Ethernet version is realized by the socket communication (TCP/IP communication) with FANUC Ethernet Board, or FANUC Fast Ethernet Board. And in case of Series 16i/18i/21i-MODEL B, Series 30i/31i/32i-MODEL A, Series 30i/31i/32i/35i-MODEL B, Series 0i-MODEL D, Series 0i-MODEL F and Power Motion i-A, Ethernet version can communicate with CNC side by the &quot;Embedded Ethernet function&quot;.
<p>Before using, refer to the necessary manual, and confirm the following items.
<ul>
<li>Settings of TCP/IP in your personal computer side.
<li>Settings of the Ethernet Board and Embedded Ethernet function in the CNC side.
<li>Physical network connection between your personal computer and the CNC.
</ul>

<!--- Delete DNC1 document('07.04.19) 
<p>DNC1/Ethernet is based on FOCAS1/Ethernet. You can add an additional function by using FOCAS1/Ethernet into DNC1/Ethernet application.
</p>

<p>The following figure indicates the relationship of FOCAS1/Ethernet and DNC1/Ethernet.

<p>&lt;Notes for Embedded Ethernet&gt;</p>
<ol>
<li>The communication using the Embedded Ethernet is processed on the CNC CPU. This means that the running condition of CNC may affect the communication performance of the Embedded Ethernet, and conversely, the communication condition of the Embedded Ethernet may affect the process of CNC.<br>
The Embedded Ethernet function is processed at lower priority than the process such as the automatic operation, or each axis process at the manual operation. Therefore, during the automatic operation, or in case that the CNC is configured so as to have many controlled axes, the communication speed may be slow.<br>
The other way, the Embedded Ethernet function is processed at higher priority than the process such as screen display process of CNC, C-language executor(except the high level task), macro executor(except the execution macro). Therefore, the performance of these processes may go down by doing the communication of the Embedded Ethernet.
<p>
<li>The following Ethernet applications cannot be used because the adequate performance may not be acquired by the above reasons. 
<ul>
<li>CNC Screen Display Function
<li>Application for the DNC operation
</ul>
<p>
<li>In case that the Embedded Ethernet is connected to the Intranet that uses many broadcast data, it may take a long time to process the broadcast data. So, it may affect the performance of the process such as screen display of CNC.
</ol>
