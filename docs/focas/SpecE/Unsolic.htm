<blockquote>
<dl>
<p>In the Unsolicited messaging function, the Message can be voluntarily notified from CNC to the personal computer according to the instruction of the ladder program or the NC program Note1).  So, in the PC application, the state of CNC can be observed without the polling process.  Arbitrary data of PMC or Macro variables Note1) can be transmitted as the Message.  In the PC application, the polling process to inquire the state of CNC regularly becomes unnecessary by using this function.

<p>The unsolicited messaging issues the window message to the PC application internally and notifies the Message.  So, Visual C++ is necessary for making the application.

<p>Note1) NC program and Macro variable can be used only by 30i/31i/32i/35i, 0i-D/F and PMi-A.
<br/>
<p>This function is supported at the following ethernet function.
